# Data Engineering Design Patterns 
## Code snippets

Welcome to the Github repository of the "Data Engineering Design Patterns" book. The organization follows the book chapters. 

Each pattern has a dedicated `README.md` that explains how to set it up on your local machine. Besides, you will often find the implementations available in 2 programming languages: Scala or Java, and Python. If there is only one implementation, it means another one was not possible.

The code snippets were ran and tested against the following configuration:

* JDK 11
* Python 3.8
* Minikube 1.22.0
* Docker 23.0.2
* docker-compose 2.17.0
* OS: Ubuntu, MacOS
